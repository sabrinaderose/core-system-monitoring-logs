## üéØ Objective
This project was designed to create a remote monitoring and log capture system using SSH, Glances, htop, dstat, and journalctl to observe Raspberry Pi performance from a separate Fedora system. The primary objectives were:

- Securely gather system health information from a Raspberry Pi 5 via SSH
- Pipe outputs into Markdown logs for readability and export
- Automate storage of those logs into an accessible and organized directory
- Create a script that can be adapted for future multi-host monitoring
- Document the process with professional formatting for GitHub and job readiness

## üñ•Ô∏è Environment & Tooling

### üîß Hardware Used
- **Remote Target:** Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB RAM), running Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit (Bookworm)
- **Client System:** Fedora Linux Workstation (host), used to execute scripts and store logs
- **Peripherals:** iPistBit 7" Touchscreen (1024x600 IPS), Vilros USB keyboard with touchpad, microSD (128GB), USB-C 27W power supply

### üíª Software Environment

**Raspberry Pi:**
- OS: Debian GNU/Linux 12 (Bookworm)
- Kernel: 6.1.34-v8+
- Services: SSH, Glances, journalctl
- Users: sabrina-admin, sabi

**Fedora Client:**
- OS: Fedora Linux 42 Workstation
- Shell: Bash 5.2+
- Editor: Kate (for reviewing logs and markdown)
- Tools: OpenSSH, notify-send, Markdown

## üõú  Network Topology
```
[ Fedora Workstation (192.168.X.X) ]
          |
          | (via SSH)
          V
[ Raspberry Pi 5 (192.168.X.X) ]
```

## üîß Step-by-Step Process

### üîπ Phase 1: Preparation
- Created SSH key for passwordless access to the Pi
- Installed glances, htop, and dstat on the Raspberry Pi
- Verified SSH access with agent forwarding
- Created initial log output structure in markdown

### üîπ Phase 2: Configuration
Developed a shell script `remote_monitor.sh` to:
- Connect to remote Pi over SSH
- Run system health tools (top, glances, dstat, journalctl)
- Format output into structured Markdown
- Save output to: `~/Documents/SystemLogs/monitoring_<hostname>_<timestamp>.md`
- Notify user of completion using notify-send

Example output file: `monitoring_raspberrypi_20250728_205123.md`

### üîπ Phase 3: Testing
Executed script multiple times to validate:
- Proper SSH connection and command output
- Log file formatting
- Accurate hostname resolution
- Log storage path and timestamped naming

Sample console output (see **Figure E**)  
Successfully rendered markdown logs using Kate (see **Figure F**)

### üîπ Phase 4: Troubleshooting
- Observed temporary SSH hang behavior
- Confirmed resolution by launching ssh-agent, adding the correct key, and removing conflicting permissions on `.ssh` configs
- Reviewed journalctl errors and suppressed non-critical system messages (e.g., WirePlumber)

## üîç Analysis & Reflection

**Successes:**
- Clean integration of system commands into markdown output
- Logs now structured and timestamped for easy audit trail
- Reusable, scalable script for multi-host monitoring with hostnames

**Lessons Learned:**
- SSH must be carefully managed, especially when chaining commands
- Markdown logs are both human-readable and Git-friendly
- Glances must be manually scoped to stdout metrics to avoid overload

## ‚úÖ Final Outcome
- Fully functional and repeatable script to monitor Raspberry Pi remotely
- Logs are automatically saved, readable, and include filtered logs and stats
- Project documents both technical skill and real-world sysadmin logic
- Estimated time invested: 4.5 hours across setup, scripting, testing, and documentation

## Interview/Resume Summary (STAR Format)
**Situation:** Needed a remote monitoring solution for Raspberry Pi to observe health metrics and log changes over time.  
**Task:** Create a tool to connect via SSH, extract metrics, and save logs in a structured format.  
**Action:** Developed a Bash script that automates SSH login, runs common sysadmin tools (htop, glances, dstat, journalctl), and exports clean markdown logs.  
**Result:** Produced scalable monitoring solution used to capture and document remote system performance, demonstrating scripting, SSH configuration, and logging best practices.
